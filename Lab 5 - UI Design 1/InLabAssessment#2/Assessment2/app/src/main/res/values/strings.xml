    <string name="content">The story behind the emblem The emblem was inspired by traditional woolen shawls worn during the winter months – when the FIFA World Cup 2022™ will take place – in Qatar and around the world.   Like football, the shawls\' popularity is a unifying force, woven into the everyday fabric of people\'s lives.   \n The typeface created to complement the emblem likewise celebrates Qatar\'s heritage with a global twist. It brings traditional Arabic calligraphy into dialogue with other global languages through the integration of elements like the kasheeda – a lengthening of the line connecting letters to enhance the flow and elegance of the written word.</string>
